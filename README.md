# ImageProcessorCore
Image processor core for hardware acceleration of image processing

This project is a parallelized design of an image processor that can be used to accelerate image processing operations
for use along side normal processors that may not have the power, speed, or capabilities to accomplish image processing
in an acceptable amount of time.
